# Improving Identification of Palliative Care Patients in Portuguese Retirement Homes and Healthcare System

## Purpose  
This project aims to enhance the identification and tracking of potential palliative care patients within retirement homes and the Portuguese healthcare system. Reliance on a patientâ€™s general appearance alone can lead to misclassification, as many individuals with serious health conditions might not appear to need palliative care, while others that might look debilitated are not necessarily in immediate need of such care. 

## Outlook
Early identification can facilitate timely interventions, improve the quality of care, and optimize resource allocation within the healthcare system. By integrating standardized clinical criteria with observations of general appearance, this project aims to help providing a more accurate and comprehensive framework for identifying palliative care needs, ensuring that patients receive the appropriate level of care at the right time.
